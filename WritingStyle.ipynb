Lighter and quieter Last year, I reviewed a quirky prototype of a gaming mouse called the Zephyr . It had a built-in fan, blowing a cool breeze against your hand to banish sweaty palms. Unfortunately, the mouse's shape didn't feel the best in hand, and the fan was noisy and buzzed frenetically when using the mouse. One year later, Zephyr Gaming has rebranded to Marsback, and their new mouse, the Zephyr Pro, is here for a second shot at active cooling in a gaming mouse. The Zephyr Pro fixes a lot of the issues faced by its predecessor, and the improvements are significant. It's now got a far more comfortable shape that's very similar to the Glorious Model O . With a flat profile and slight comfort grooves along the sides and mouse buttons, it feels much better in hand than the Zephyr. It is a safe, versatile shape, suitable for almost any grip style. However, the mouse is quite large, which means that certain grip styles such as the fingertip grip work better for those with bigger hands. The geometric open shell design brings its weight down to 69g, and it feels a lot more nimble than the Zephyr. Build quality is good, and there is minimal flexing when pressing down on the sides. And for a mouse with actual moving parts, I'm happy to see that there's no rattling when shaking the mouse either. When it comes to the fan, it's far quieter than before and also less disruptive. The annoying thrum that plagued the original is gone, and the fan positioning has been tweaked, blowing directly upward instead of at an angle. This seems to have improved cooling somewhat, and I can see this coming in handy for you if you have sweaty palms. The shell cutouts are larger than you'd typically see on a mouse, which probably helps with airflow as well. You can still feel the vibrations through the mouse, but it's faint enough that it kind of fades into the background after a while and you don't really notice it. The fan does not affect tracking either, so you don't have to worry about that. The Omron switches on the Zephyr Pro are rated for 50 million clicks. They are crisp and responsive, but are not as tactile as Huano or certain Kailh switches. There is minimal post-travel too, the same of which goes for the side buttons. The scroll wheel is inoffensive and quiet, with well-defined notches that allow for precise adjustments. The stock PTFE feet provide a smooth glide right out of the box, with no noticeable scratchiness. Like most other mice on the market today, the Zephyr Pro is also equipped with a flexible paracord cable. It isn't the softest cable I've used, but it does the job well enough with minimal cable drag. The sensor is a 16,000DPI PixArt PMW3389 optical sensor, found on many top mice today. It offers flawless tracking as expected, with no noticeable acceleration or jitter. You can set up to seven DPI stages in the software and toggle between them using the dedicated DPI button. The scroll wheel then doubles as a colour-coded indicator for you to quickly see what sensitivity you're on. The Zephyr Pro has its own software that lets you customise DPI, button functionality, RGB lighting, lift-off distance and more. The interface could definitely use some polish, but there's a ton of functionality packed in there. Interestingly enough, there is no way to adjust the fan speed, and there is just a button at the bottom that you hold to turn off the fan. To be fair, I didn't see any need to tweak the speed of the fan while I was using the mouse, but more control over what is clearly the marquee feature of the mouse would be nice. Conclusion The Zephyr Pro is a unique mouse in a very crowded space. It is a huge step up from the original, sporting a better overall build, more comfortable shape, and lighter design. More importantly, the fan is no longer a nuisance, and it could actually help you if you have sweaty palms. Elsewhere, Marsback has taken care to equip the mouse with everything you'd expect from a gaming mouse in 2021, including a paracord cable and customisable RGB lighting. At US$59 , the Zephyr Pro is pretty attractively priced as well. If you constantly find yourself wiping your palms down, or just want to try something different, it is well worth a look. You can get the Marsback Zephyr Pro here , but don't be fooled into thinking the sale price is US$59 - this is its normal price.

            "\n",
            "<p>In a nutshell, the new buds tap on many of Apple’s audio advances, offering features like Spatial Audio, while also improving its overall robustness with longer battery life and an improved design. </p>\n",
            "\n",
            "<p>The third-generation AirPods comes with new contours for better fit and better funnelling of audio directly into your ears. The <strong>stem is now shorter</strong> than its predecessor, and both the earbuds and its charging case now pack IPX4-certified resistance against water droplets and perspiration.</p>\n",

            "<p>The custom driver in each earbud comes with a high dynamic range amplifier, covering the entire audible frequency range (from bass to high treble notes). AirPods also come with an acoustic wind filter mesh on their microphones. According to Apple, the buds now use <strong>AAC-ELD</strong>, a speech codec offering “full HD voice quality” for voice calls.</p>\n",

While it doesn’t feature active noise-cancellation (that would be for its Pro lineup), Apple said that the third-gen AirPods have beamforming microphones to block out ambient noises and help focus on user voice.

At the 18 October 2021 Apple Event keynote earlier today, the tech firm announced its third-generation Apple AirPods (colloquially AirPods 3) true wireless earbuds. In a nutshell, the new buds tap on many of Apple’s audio advances, offering features like Spatial Audio, while also improving its overall robustness with longer battery life and an improved design. The third-generation AirPods comes with new contours for better fit and better funnelling of audio directly into your ears. The stem is now shorter than its predecessor, and both the earbuds and its charging case now pack IPX4-certified resistance against water droplets and perspiration. The custom driver in each earbud comes with a high dynamic range amplifier, covering the entire audible frequency range (from bass to high treble notes). AirPods also come with an acoustic wind filter mesh on their microphones. According to Apple, the buds now use AAC-ELD , a speech codec offering “full HD voice quality” for voice calls. Another new feature in these AirPods is Adaptive EQ . The AirPods now tune sound in real-time by basing it on the user’s ear fit. An inward-facing microphone monitors for sounds, while Adaptive EQ uses computational audio to tune and compensate based on the user’s hearing preferences and limitations. Spatial audio - Apple’s much-vaunted surround sound technology - creates a 3D, theatre-like audio experience. It also works with tracks and shows with Dolby Atmos metadata to maximise its Spatial Audio capabilities. Returning features include its one-touch setup (where your devices automatically detect a new pair of AirPods), and auto-pausing of playback when AirPods are removed. While it doesn’t feature active noise-cancellation (that would be for its Pro lineup), Apple said that the third-gen AirPods have beamforming microphones to block out ambient noises and help focus on user voice. Expectedly, AirPods also work with Apple’s voice assistant, Siri . Finally, Apple extended the AirPods battery life with up to six hours of listening time and four hours of talk time, longer than 2019’s AirPods . The new buds also can use Magsafe wireless charging . If you are on iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 , Spatial audio works with Group FaceTime calls . It makes other callers sound like they are coming from the direction based on the caller's position on your screen (only on iPhone and iPads with A12 Bionic chipset or later). AirPods are also a part of the Find My network , in case you misplace it. The third-generation AirPods officially retail at S$269 , and are available for pre-order \"soon \" to order now  at Apple’s online store . They will be available in stores on 26 October . < Prev Page 1 of 1 - Apple’s third-generation AirPods features spatial audio, longer battery life, and reimagined design (Updated) Page 1 of 1 - Apple’s third-generation AirPods features spatial audio, longer battery life, and reimagined design (Updated) Page 1 of 1 Page 1 of 1 - Apple’s third-generation AirPods features spatial audio, longer battery life, and reimagined design (Updated) Next > Join HWZ's Telegram channel here and catch all the latest tech news!

            "Note:  This article was first published on 19 October 2021 and has been updated with local availability information. At the 18 October 2021 Apple Event keynote earlier today, the tech firm announced its  third-generation Apple AirPods  (colloquially AirPods 3) true wireless earbuds.  In a nutshell, the new buds tap on many of Apple’s audio advances, offering features like Spatial Audio, while also improving its overall robustness with longer battery life and an improved design.  The third-generation AirPods comes with new contours for better fit and better funnelling of audio directly into your ears. The  stem is now shorter  than its predecessor, and both the earbuds and its charging case now pack IPX4-certified resistance against water droplets and perspiration. The custom driver in each earbud comes with a high dynamic range amplifier, covering the entire audible frequency range (from bass to high treble notes). AirPods also come with an acoustic wind filter mesh on their microphones. According to Apple, the buds now use  AAC-ELD , a speech codec offering “full HD voice quality” for voice calls. Another new feature in these AirPods is  Adaptive EQ . The AirPods now tune sound in real-time by basing it on the user’s ear fit. An inward-facing microphone monitors for sounds, while Adaptive EQ uses computational audio to tune and compensate based on the user’s hearing preferences and limitations.  Spatial audio  - Apple’s much-vaunted surround sound technology - creates a 3D, theatre-like audio experience. It also  works with tracks and shows with Dolby Atmos metadata  to maximise its Spatial Audio capabilities. Returning features include its  one-touch setup  (where your devices automatically detect a new pair of AirPods), and auto-pausing of playback when AirPods are removed. While it doesn’t feature active noise-cancellation (that would be for its Pro lineup), Apple said that the third-gen AirPods have beamforming microphones to block out ambient noises and help focus on user voice. Expectedly, AirPods also work with Apple’s voice assistant,  Siri . Finally, Apple  extended the AirPods battery life  with up to six hours of listening time and four hours of talk time, longer than  2019’s AirPods . The new buds also can use  Magsafe wireless charging .  If you are on  iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 ,  Spatial audio works with Group FaceTime calls . It makes other callers sound like they are coming from the direction based on the caller's position on your screen (only on iPhone and iPads with A12 Bionic chipset or later).  AirPods are also a part of the Find My network , in case you misplace it. The third-generation AirPods officially retail at  S$269 , and are  available  for pre-order \"soon \" to order now  at Apple’s online store . They will be available in stores on  26 October .

        "article1 = 'NEW DELHI: For Delhi resident Suman Milind, rising prices in India are casting a long shadow this year over the upcoming Diwali festival of lights. The 33-year-old homemaker is tightening her purse strings and altering her spending habits, thanks to soaring costs of fuel, transport and many manufactured items, coupled with stagnant incomes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \"Earlier we used to get four or five boxes of dry fruits during festivals, but now we hardly get one or two. Because of the high prices,\" said Milind, adding that her family has reduced spending on food too by cutting back on meat to just once a week compared to several times a week earlier. Millions of Indian households are facing similar strains on their budgets ahead of Diwali, which this year falls in early November and marks the country\\'s busiest shopping season for consumer goods. Many are foregoing big-ticket purchases such as television sets and jewellery this festive season, according to half a dozen people Reuters spoke to and a consumer survey by Mumbai-based consultancy Axis My India, threatening to slow an economy recovering strongly from the worst of COVID-19. Pump prices of petrol and diesel are up nearly 35 per cent from a year ago and cooking gas by more than 50 per cent, severely hitting more than three-quarters of households, economists said. \"The sky-rocketing prices of petrol, cooking gas are unbearable when our earnings are still down by nearly 30 per cent from the pre-pandemic period,\" said Sultan Singh Tomar, 53, who supplies incense sticks and kitchenware to shops in New Delhi on his scooter. He said his petrol bill was up by 600 rupees (US$8) from a year ago and refilling the cooking gas cylinder was costlier by 400 rupees. Tomar is among millions of people working in the informal sector who dipped into savings during the pandemic and are now forced to pare back household spending.For months India\\'s consumer-price-based inflation stayed above the central-bank\\'s comfort level of 6 per cent driven by a rise in food prices.In September the consumer price index eased to 4.35 per cent, helped by a softening of food prices which make up nearly half of the index. Economists said that painted a better picture than what households are actually facing.According to an October report by Axis My India on consumer spending trends, more than 88 per cent of respondents in a survey said they will not be buying air conditioners, televisions, washing machines or jewellery this festival season and nearly half said they will make low-ticket purchases such as clothes. There is not much that Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s government can do to alleviate the pain as global crude oil prices hit a three-year high at US$85 a barrel, piling up the pressure on a country that imports 80 per cent of its oil.Bidisha Ganguly, chief economist at industry chamber, Confederation of Indian Industries, said federal and state governments should cut fuel taxes, the highest among the major economies, as higher fuel prices posed a risk of building up of medium term inflationary pressures.\"(Otherwise) corporate earnings will be impacted in sectors where producers are unable to pass on the cost increases,\" she said, adding global shortages were already driving up commodity costs for many products.REDUCED FOOTFALLS Private economists have warned that annual wholesale-price-based inflation - a proxy for producers\\' prices - staying in double digits for sixth months in a row could further fuel inflationary pressures as companies pass on rising costs to consumers.Already some retailers said rising raw material costs were impacting their sales.\"Our sales are not even half of what we used to have during the festival period,\" said Kawaljit Singh, who sells utensils from a shop in Chandani Chowk in the old quarter of Delhi.He said a rise in prices of metals like steel and copper had pushed up prices of utensils, cookers, festival lighting and gift items by 15 per cent to 20 per cent in the last four to five months.Because of rising prices and other market uncertainties, Delhi-based company auditor Lalit Vats said his family had downgraded to non-branded products and visited the wholesale markets to hunt for bargains. \\\"Government can talk about easing of inflation, but people know that costs of every item has gone up,\\\" lamented his mother Anita Vats.Source: Reuters/ng'"

        "article2 = ('BANGKOK: Travellers from 45 low-risk countries who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will be able to visit Thailand without quarantine requirements from Nov 1 if they enter the country by air and test negative for the coronavirus.The announcement was made on Thursday (Oct 21) by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha on his Facebook page. “We need to move faster and do it now because by waiting for everything to be perfect first, we could be too late,” said Prayut.“Moreover, tourists may decide to travel to other countries instead.”Initially, Thailand only planned to allow travellers from about 10 \"low-risk\" countries, including Singapore, China and the United States to enter by air without quarantine requirements if they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and test negative for the virus before and after their flight.The list, which consists of 45 countries and Hong Kong, was issued by Thani Thongphakdi, permanent secretary at the foreign ministry.According to the foreign ministry, travellers must have resided in the eligible countries and territories for at least 21 consecutive days and will need to take a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test within 72 hours of travelling to Thailand.Upon their arrival in Thailand, they also need to take an RT-PCR test and wait for the result at an approved hotel for one night or until they receive a negative test result. Medical insurance with a minimum coverage of US$50,000 is also compulsory.Visitors from these countries can visit Thailand quarantine-free from Nov 1 Australia'\n",
